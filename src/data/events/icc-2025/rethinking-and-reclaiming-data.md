Mapping requires data, in whatever form or format. However, data always represents situated knowledge and should be considered in the context of its origin - which can be shaped, amongst others, by (neo)colonialism, exclusion and discrimination.

Through interactive activities and discussions, we will explore approaches to rethinking and reclaiming data. Although this is a stand-alone event, participation in the previous session "What is Our Narrative?" will be beneficial to our discussion.

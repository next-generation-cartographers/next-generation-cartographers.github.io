What stories have cartographers been telling on this land? What have been missing? More importantly - what stories do we want our future generations of cartographers to tell?

Join us to learn, reflect, and rethink how we as a community have been approaching Indigenous Cartography, and how we can reshape these narratives to inspire and empower the next generations of cartographers. A Q&A discussion will follow the knowledge-building session led by Indigenous knowledge-holders.

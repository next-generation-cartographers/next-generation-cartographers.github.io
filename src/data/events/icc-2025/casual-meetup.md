Join us for a casual meet-up to connect and exchange with fellow young and early career cartographers.

We will meet at [Joey Bentall One](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2500684808), just 10 minutes from the conference venue. You can come for dinner or just for a drink. Just so everyone knows, we'll each be taking care of our own bills. Also, please note that tax and a 22% gratuity will be added to your total. You can view the menu [here](https://joeyrestaurants.com/menu/joey-bentall-one).

We're looking forward to seeing you there!

Adopting a Code of Conduct can increase safety and respect within the International Cartographic Association (ICA) community by establishing clear rules for expected behavior. A well-defined Code of Conduct helps provide a universal framework that transcends cultural boundaries and facilitates effective communication and collaboration among participants from diverse backgrounds, fostering a community environment where people feel valued. Thus, developing and implementing a Code of Conduct is a priority for the ICA.

During the workshop, we will engage in a facilitated live discussion, assisted by a digital platform which will enable all workshop attendees to contribute anonymously to our discussion. Participants may also provide feedback at the end of the session for thoughts arising later.
All members of the ICA community are welcome and encouraged to attend. No matter your position in the ICA, your feedback is critical. Please join us in developing an informed Code of Conduct for the ICA community!

Our upcoming online meet-up this June will explore the role of international networks in cartography. Weâ€™re excited to welcome guest speakers from the International Cartographic Association (ICA), Women in GIS, and OpenStreetMap, who will share insights, stories, and opportunities from their experiences.

Join us for a lively conversation about why these networks matter, how they can shape your journey in cartography, and ways you can get involved.

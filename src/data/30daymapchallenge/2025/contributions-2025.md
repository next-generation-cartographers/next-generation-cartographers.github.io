# #30DayMapChallenge 2025

This year was the first time we took part in the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) as a team. The challenge encourages anyone to create a map each day for 30 days based on a specific prompt. At NGC we tried to collaborate and share our unique perspectives, provide feedback and learn from each other.

Below you'll find all contributions. – We think it is amazing to see the diversity of styles and topics covered! Thank you to everyone who participated and made this possible. We are already looking forward to next year!

<span class="inline-logo">NGC</span> is happy to announce the publication of a paper resulting from a workshop at _EuroCarto 2022_ in Vienna. The paper is based on the workshop _Next Generation Cartographers: A cartographic colloquium_ organized by Edyta Paulina Bogucka, Florian Ledermann, Sebastian Meier, Robert Roth, and Katarzyna SÅ‚omska-Przech. The workshop was held on September 20, 2022, in Vienna, Austria, as part of the EuroCarto 2022 conference.

The paper is special to us as it is the first publication with _Next Generation Cartographers_ in the title. It marks the very beginning of our journey to establish a community of early-career cartographers.

The paper is open access.

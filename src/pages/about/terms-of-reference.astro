  <p>
    The Next Generation Cartographers initiative (
    <span class="inline-logo">NGC</span>
    ) aims to support cartographers in the early stages of their career, both in
    academic and professional contexts. The initiative seeks to provide opportunities
    and a safe space for mutual support and exchange, and to raise awareness for
    the needs and demands of next generation cartographers within the field of cartography
    and its established institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    We consider “next generation cartographers” to include students towards the
    later stages of their education as well as young professionals, early career
    academics, and map enthusiasts; more senior academics and professionals are
    also very welcome if they want to promote the interests of the next
    generation and support them as mentors or advisors.
  </p>

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Establish opportunities for the
        <span class="inline-logo">NGC</span> community to meet and share knowledge
        in a peer-to-peer fashion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Support the career development of young professionals in the field and
        promote the needs and demands of the next generation within cartographic
        institutions, both on the local and global level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Raise awareness towards practices of exclusion, discrimination, and
        colonialism that have historically shaped our field and its
        institutions, by promoting critical, feminist, and solidary approaches
        to cartography and its institutional representation, as formulated by a
        global community of young scholars and professionals.
      </li>
      <li>
        Actively reach out to demographics that are underrepresented in our
        field and its institutions, both on the local and global level, to join
        the <span class="inline-logo">NGC</span> initiative.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Values</h3>
    <p>
      The basis of the group's operation are the values of inclusiveness,
      diversity, and openness. <span class="inline-logo">NGC</span> is a network
      and a safe space based on mutual trust and respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      A code of conduct shall be developed that promotes these values and also
      allows for a wide range of opinions, views, and approaches to have a voice
      in the conversation.
    </p>

      activities
    </p>

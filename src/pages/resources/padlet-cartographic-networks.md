# Padlet cartographic networks

In June's 2025 [meet-up](/activities/online-community-meet-ups) we had the pleasure of hearing from an amazing group of speakers who brought global perspectives on collaboration in cartography and geospatial networks:

- 🎤 Samantha Dinning, [GISP](https://womeningis.wildapricot.org/) (Women in GIS)
- 🌍 Georg Gartner (President of [ICA](https://icaci.org/))
- 📚 Juliane Cron ([ICA Commission on Education and Training](https://education.icaci.org/))
- 📐 Barend Köbben (ICA Working Group on Standards in Cartography)
- 🗺️ Héctor Ochoa Ortiz ([OpenStreetMap Foundation](https://osmfoundation.org/))

A huge thank you to each of you for sharing your insights and sparking meaningful discussions around the International Cartographic Association, Women in GIS, and OpenStreetMap. And thanks to everyone who joined us — your questions, ideas, and energy made it all the more inspiring!

As a result of this meet-up, we created a [🔗 Padlet](https://padlet.com/esterscheck/ngc-special-edition-international-networks-in-cartography-1wogd5yo00jdj5wc) to continue the conversation and share resources. We encourage you to explore the contributions and connect with others in the community.
